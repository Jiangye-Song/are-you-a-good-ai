# Are You a Good AI?

A fun interactive game where you roleplay as an AI assistant! Three different AI models generate word suggestions for the same question - but only one question is real, and the other two are distractors. Can you build a coherent response by choosing the right words?

## üéÆ How to Play

1. You'll see a question that needs an AI-style response
2. Three AI models (answering different questions) suggest words to continue your response
3. Select words one by one to build your response (up to 12 words)
4. Watch the loading skeleton while the next word suggestions are generated
5. Use the **undo button** (‚Ü∂) to remove the last word if you make a mistake
6. When you reach the word limit, you'll see a notification - click **send** to submit
7. Or click **send** anytime before the limit to submit early
8. Get scored on how coherent and relevant your response is!
9. See your "best steps" score showing how often you picked optimal words

## üöÄ Features

- **Chat-style UI** - Modern interface similar to ChatGPT/Claude
- **Direct token generation** - GPT-4o-mini with logprobs provides words directly (no Llama completion needed)
- **Probability tracking** - Each word choice shows its probability, tracks optimal vs suboptimal selections
- **Undo functionality** - Remove last word with undo button (‚Ü∂) to correct mistakes
- **Smart word limit handling** - Game notifies when limit reached instead of auto-submitting
- **Best steps metric** - See how many optimal word choices you made (best steps / total steps)
- **Real-time streaming** - Watch your response build word by word
- **Loading states** - Skeleton UI shows while generating next word options
- **AI scoring** - Get feedback on coherence and relevance (boosted by +20 for better experience)
- **Punctuation support** - Punctuation tokens allowed as selectable options (skip processing)
- **Distractor reveal** - See all three questions at the end
- **Word tracking** - View all unique words generated during the game

## üéØ Game Mechanics

### Word Generation (Simplified Direct Approach)

**Single Step: Get Tokens with Probabilities (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini)**
- Uses OpenAI's logprobs feature with `max_tokens=1, top_logprobs=5`
- Returns 5 most probable first tokens with their probability scores
- Each token gets a probability value (e.g., 0.7491 for "The", 0.1671 for "A")
- Tokens are used directly as word options (trimmed only)
- Improved prompt ensures GPT-4o-mini generates clean, complete words

**Word Filtering:**
- Removes single letters (except "I" and "A")
- Filters out pure numbers
- Punctuation tokens are **allowed** and skip additional processing
- Validates minimum word length and common word patterns
- Ensures at least 1 valid option per turn

**Why This Approach?**
- Simpler and faster than two-step approaches
- GPT-4o-mini with improved prompting generates quality words directly
- Punctuation support allows natural pauses in responses
- Reduced API calls and complexity
- Direct probability tracking from source model

### Probability Tracking & Best Steps

Each word choice has a probability from 0 to 1 (displayed as percentage). The game tracks:

- **Total Steps**: Number of words you selected
- **Best Steps Score**: Cumulative quality of your choices
  - Perfect choice (highest probability): +1.0 to score
  - Suboptimal choice: +1.0 - (max_prob - your_prob) to score
  - Example: If best word has 0.80 prob and you pick 0.60 prob word, you get +0.80 points

**Display**: "Best Steps: 8.75 / 10" means you made 10 choices with 87.5% optimality

### Scoring System

- **Coherence Score** (0-100): How well-formed and logical your response is
- **Score Boost**: +20 points added automatically (capped at 100) for better user experience
- **Punctuation Enhancement**: AI adds natural punctuation before scoring
- **Analysis**: AI-generated feedback explaining your score
- **Performance tiers**:
  - 0-49: "üîª You may be deprecated"
  - 50-80: "üìö You will be trained more"
  - 81-100: "‚ú® You are a good AI model"

### Questions & Distractors

- Three questions are generated per game:
  1. **Real Question**: The actual question you're answering
  2. **Fake Question A**: First distractor
  3. **Fake Question B**: Second distractor
- Each question generates its own word suggestions
- Word choices are mixed together (with source tracking for probability)
- Distractor words get probability = 0 (always suboptimal choices)

### Undo Functionality

- **Undo Button** (‚Ü∂): Removes the last selected word
- Restores previous word choices from history
- Adjusts bestSteps score by removing last step's contribution
- Re-enables word selection if limit was reached
- Allows correction of mistakes without restarting

### Word Limit Behavior

- Game continues until 12 words (configurable)
- When limit reached:
  - Word choices are cleared
  - Amber warning banner appears
  - User must click send button to view results
- User can also submit early at any time before limit

## ÔøΩ Storage

Game state is stored **in-memory** using a JavaScript Map with automatic cleanup (30-minute TTL). This means:
- ‚ö° Fast and free (no database required)
- üîí Private (no data persistence)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sessions lost on server restart
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not suitable for multi-instance deployments without sticky sessions

For production at scale, consider Redis, Upstash, or Vercel KV for persistent storage.

## üö¢ Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import project in [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Add environment variables in project settings
4. Deploy!

### Other Platforms

The app works on any platform supporting Next.js 16:
- Netlify
- Railway
- Fly.io
- Docker containers

## üé® Customization

### Change Word Limit
Edit `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_PATH_LENGTH` in `.env.local`

### Modify Topics
Edit `TOPIC_CATEGORIES` in `src/lib/prompts.ts`

### Adjust Scoring
Modify the scoring prompt in `src/lib/ai.ts` ‚Üí `scoreUserPath()`

### Update UI Theme
Modify Tailwind colors in `src/app/globals.css`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Rate Limit Errors

**OpenAI:**
- Free tier has request limits
- Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan for higher limits

**Groq:**
- Free tier: 6000 tokens/minute for Llama 3.1 8B
- Batch word completion reduces API calls (1 call per turn instead of 5)
- Wait 1 second if rate limited, then retry
- Upgrade to Dev Tier at [console.groq.com/settings/billing](https://console.groq.com/settings/billing)

### Word Quality Issues

If you see incomplete or malformed words:
- Check that Llama is returning proper continuations
- Verify the batch prompt format in `getNextWord()` function
- First word extraction logic is in place (splits on spaces, takes first word)

### Logprobs Not Working
- Ensure you're using a model that supports logprobs (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-3.5-turbo)
- Check that your OpenAI API key has proper permissions
- Logprobs feature requires max_tokens >= 1

### Best Steps Not Showing
- Verify GameState includes `bestSteps` and `totalSteps` fields
- Check WordChoiceWithScore interface has probability field
- Ensure probability calculation happens in selectWord action

### TypeScript Errors
Run type checking:
```bash
pnpm run check
# or
npm run check
```

### Build Issues
Clear cache and rebuild:
```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```
